# Problem1

Given a list of N integers A = [a1, a2, ..., aN], you have to find those integers which are repeated at least K times.

If there are multiple elements in A which are repeated at least K times, then print these elements ordered by their first occurrence in the list.


Let's say A = [4, 5, 2, 5, 4, 3, 1, 3, 4] and K = 2. Then the output is [4, 5, 3]
* Because these numbers have appeared at least 2 times. 
* Among these numbers, 
* 4 has appeared first at position 1, 
* 5 has appeared next at position 2, 
* and 3 has appeared thereafter at position 6. 
* That's why, we print in the order 4, 5 and finally 3
